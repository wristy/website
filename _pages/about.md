I am Zhang Ke Wei, a second-year Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in the People and Intelligence threads. I am a recipient of the National Science Scholarship from the Agency of Science, Technology and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)) in Singapore. I am interested in machine learning, particularly how it may be used for social good and remain aligned with human values.
