	abstract = {Current prosthetic hands are extremely expensive and thus inaccessible to patients with upper limb deficiency in
impoverished countries. Hence, we wish to 3D-print a low-cost prosthetic hand. Analysis of electromyography
(EMG) signals with the bandpass filter and fast fourier transform (FFT) yielded characteristic frequencies and
amplitudes unique to certain motions, identifying motions with a 10\% total error rate, thus this method is suitable
for identification of patientsâ€™ desired motions and control of the hand. Furthermore, the system allows for quick
patient training and adaptation for a fairly accurate identification of motion. A novel electrically conductive
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/carbon nanotube (ABS/CNT) composite can be 3D-printed with the hand, allowing
it to interface with touchscreens. Testing of ABS/CNT strips with different surface areas on an capacitive
touchscreen revealed a direct linear correlation between the effectiveness of the finger-touchscreen interface and
the surface area of ABS/CNT used. Experiments with the finger on a capacitive touchscreen at different velocities
revealed a inverse linear relationship between the velocity of the finger and the effectiveness of the
finger-touchscreen interface. Overall, a proof of concept of a digit capable of interacting with a touchscreen has
been demonstrated and shows the feasibility of such an endeavour.},
